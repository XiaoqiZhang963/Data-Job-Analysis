## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using the data of Glassdoor data job listings to better understand:

1. What data job pays the highest?
2. Where are the job opportunities (Industry, location)?
3. What are the degree requirements for different data jobs?
4. What are employers' most desired skills?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

A notebook is available here to showcase work related to the above questions. 
There are four csv files containing the data used in this project.

## Results <a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@xiaoqi.zhang963/considering-a-career-in-data-a882dbc5851b).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to [picklesueat](https://github.com/picklesueat/data_jobs_data) for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Github link available [here](https://github.com/picklesueat/data_jobs_data).
